# About

I am a JVM web developer who enjoys working with containers.

Currently working at Buzzmove as a Full Stack Developer.

My main interests are:
- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
- [Spring cloud](http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/)

I am currently focusing on improving my knowledge of Platforms as a service and seeing how to truly manage a microservice architecture in production.

My pipeline of learning includes:
- [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/)
- [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/)
- [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/)
- [the ELK stack](https://www.elastic.co/products)

In my spare time I enjoy watching films and TV Series, playing football, and cooking.
