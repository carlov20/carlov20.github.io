I am a JVM web developer who enjoys working with containers.

Currently working at Discover Financials as an Associate Developer.

My main interests are:

* https://www.java.com/en/[Java]

* https://www.docker.com/[Docker]
* https://facebook.github.io/react/[React]

I am currently focusing on expanding my knowledge of Platforms as a service and seeing how batch processing fits into being cloud native.

My pipeline of learning includes:

- http://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes]

In my spare time I enjoy watching films and TV Series, playing football, and cooking.
